Titanic analysis prepared for Kaggle competition submission
Titanic- Machine Learning from Disaster using Python
Introduction
This predictive analysis, using Python data analysis and machine learning libraries, is for Kaggle's competition for "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster". This is my first kernel for Kaggle.

Background
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

Problem Statement
Analyse what sorts of people were likely to survive the Titanic disaster. In particular, apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

Titanic Data
Overview
The data has been split into two groups:

training set (train.csv) test set (test.csv) The training set should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger. Your model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. You can also use feature engineering to create new features.

The test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.
